## Research Question
How my space adapted to our practice? In general, how a passionate activities can influence an organization of our own space?

How is the organisation of my appartment with this practice? What are the adptation?
How can we explain these behaviors? What are the consequences?

One or two setences, describing questions that your project evokes. For example: "What new relationships can we have with traditional altars?"

## Research

I have listing the materials and elements related to our practice within my apartment.

I analyzed how the apartment is organized and how this practice affects that organization. I observed how I work during this activity, as well as how my roommate does.

I looked at our positions, what we talk about, and what we listen to while working. I took a lot of pictures and videos to analyze our practice and keep the conversation and the sound. I noticed that we tend to spread out and overwhelm the space, so I mapped how the space evolves over time.

I concluded that we’re quite messy with this practice. Indeed, beads and other materials are scattered throughout the apartment, spreading everywhere like a kind of "contagion." We even have no chairs left because we’ve placed beads on them. Finally, I observed that we have two different working styles: she prefers working on the floor, while I prefer the table.
